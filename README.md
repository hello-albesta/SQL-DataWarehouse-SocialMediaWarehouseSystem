# SQL-DataWarehouse-SocialMediaWarehouseSystem
This repository houses my project for a social media warehouse system that utilizes the SnowFlake schema. It involves storing data from the Social Media Marketing, User, and Event database, which contains information on Facebook and Instagram ad engagement with users. An instance of this engagement is when a user conducts a transaction.
